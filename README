XSCHEM : schematic capture and netlisting EDA tool

Xschem is a schematic capture program, it allows creation of hierarchical representation
of circuits with a top down approach . By focusing on interfaces, hierarchy and instance
properties a complex system can be described in terms of simpler building blocks. A VHDL
or Verilog or Spice netlist can be generated from the drawn schematic, allowing the 
simulation of the circuit. Key feature of the program is its drawing engine written in C
and using directly the Xlib drawing primitives; this gives very good speed performance,
even on very big circuits. The user interface is built with the Tcl-Tk toolkit, tcl is
also the extension language used.
