XSCHEM : schematic capture and netlisting EDA tool

Xschem is a schematic capture program, it allows creation of hierarchical representation
of circuits with a top down approach . By focusing on interfaces, hierarchy and instance
properties a complex system can be described in terms of simpler building blocks. A VHDL
or Verilog or Spice netlist can be generated from the drawn schematic, allowing the 
simulation of the circuit. Key feature of the program is its drawing engine written in C
and using directly the Xlib drawing primitives; this gives very good speed performance,
even on very big circuits. The user interface is built with the Tcl-Tk toolkit, tcl is
also the extension language used.

INSTALLATION AND MANUAL

http://stefanschippers.host-ed.me/stefan/xschem.html

BUILDING

go to the 'src' directory, edit the Makefile, in particular the 'prefix' and the
'library_prefix' variables, also check that the TCLVER variable matches the tcl version 
installed on the system.

In order to build xschem you need
- gcc
- tcl-tk and development header files (tcl8.x, tcl8.x-dev, tk8.x, tk8.x-dev)
- bison grammar parser
- flex lexycal analyzer
- an awk implementation (gawk or mawk are OK)
- X11 and development header files
- libxpm and development files (libxpm, libxpm-dev)

If all dependencies are met 'make' will build the program

INSTALL

If destination paths are correctly set in the Makefile: 'make install'
