 <h1>COMPONENT INSTANTIATION</h1><br>
 <p>
  In the <a href="run_xschem.html">RUN XSCHEM</a> slide some instructions were provided as examples to
  place a component in the schematic. Now we will cover the topic in more detail with emphasis on
  component properties. Start by opening a test schematic window (you may delete any existing 
  stuff in it if any).
 </p>
 <img src="load_schematic.png">
 <p>
  Now start by inserting a component, consider for example <tt>devices/nmos4.sym</tt>; press the
  <tt>Insert</tt> key, navigate to the <tt>devices</tt> design library and open the <tt>nmos4.sym</tt>
  symbol.
 </p>
 <img src="nmos4_symbol.png">
 <p>
  Now draw some wires on each pin of the nmos; place the mouse pointer on the component pins and
  use the <tt>'w'</tt> bindkey.
 </p>
 <img src="nmos4_wires.png">
 <p> 
  we need now to put labels on wire ends: use the <tt>Insert</tt> key and locate the 
  <tt>devices/lab_pin.sym</tt> symbol. After the <tt>lab_pin</tt> symbol is placed you can move it
  by selecting it with the mouse and pressing the <tt>'m'</tt> bindkey. You can also flip
  ( <tt>'F'</tt>) and rotate while moving (<tt>'R'</tt>) to adjust the orientation. After
  placing the first one you may copy the others from it (<tt>'c'</tt> bindkey). The end result 
  should look  like this:
 </p>
 <img src="nmos4_labels.png">
 <p> 
  This is what an electrical circuit is all about: a network of wires and components. In this 
  schematic we have 5 components (4 labels and one mos) and 4 nets. It is not mandatory to put a 
  wire segment between component pins; we could equally well do this: 
 </p>
 <img src="nmos4_labels2.png">
 <p> 
  This circuit is absolutely equivalent to the previous one: it will produce the same 
  device connectivity netlist.<br>
  Now we need to set appropriate labels on the NMOS terminals. This is -again- accomplished with 
  component properties. Select the wire label on the nmos source pin and press the <tt>'q'</tt>
  bindkey: 
 </p>
 <img src="nmos4_editprop.png">
 <p>
  Now, replace the 'xxx' default string in the dialog with a different name (example: SOURCE)
  After clicking <tt>OK</tt> the source terminal will have the right label.
 </p>
 <img src="nmos4_editprop2.png">
 <p>
  repeat the process for the remaining GATE, DRAIN, BODY terminals; 
 </p>
 <img src="nmos4_editprop3.png">
 <p>
  The following picture shows the <tt>lab_pin</tt> component with its properties and
  the corresponding symbol definition with its global properties (remember global properties in 
  the <a href="xschem_properties.html">xschem_properties</a> slide)
 </p>
 <img src="properties.png" style="width:70%;">
 <p>
  when building the netlist XSCHEM will look for wires that touch the red square of the lab_pin
  component and name that wires with the component 'lab' property.
  for example the SPICE netlist of the circuit will be: 
  <pre class="code">m1 DRAIN GATE SOURCE BODY nmos w=5u l=0.18u m=1</pre>
 </p>
 <p>
  We need now to edit the nmos properties. Select it and press the <tt>'q'</tt> bindkey
 </p>
 <img src="nmos_properties.png">
 <p>
  from the edit properties dialog you see there are 5 attributes with values defined:
 </p>
  <ul>
  <li> The component name <tt>name=m1</tt>.</li>
  <li> The spice model to be used in simulation <tt>model=nmos</tt>.</li>
  <li> The transistor width <tt>w=5u</tt>.</li>
  <li> The transistor channel length <tt>l=0.18u</tt>.</li>
  <li> The number of parallel transistors (multiplicity) <tt>m=1</tt>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  We have never defined a value for these properties. These are the default values defined in the
  <tt>template</tt> attribute in the global <tt>nmos4.sym</tt> property string.
 </p>
 <img src="nmos_properties2.png">
 <p>
  We may want to change the dimensions of the transistor; simply change the <tt>w</tt> and
  <tt>l</tt> attribute values.<br>
  Also the component name may be changed as long as it is unique in the current schematic window.
  All simulators require that components are unique, it is not permitted to have 2 components
  with identical name, so XSCHEM enforces this. 
  </p>
 <img src="nmos_properties3.png">

  <p>
  If a name is set that matches an existing component
  xschem will rename it keeping the first letter (<tt>m</tt> in this example) and appending a number
  (so you might end up in something like <tt>m23</tt> if there are many devices).
 </p>
 <p class="important">
  the <tt>name</tt> attribute is unique in the schematic window, and must be placed first in the
  property string. The name is also used by xschem to efficiently index it in the internal
  hash tables.
