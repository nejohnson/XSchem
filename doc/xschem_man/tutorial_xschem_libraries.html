 <h1> TUTORIAL: Manage XSCHEM design / symbol libraries </h1>
 <p>
  There are 2 ways to describe symbols in xschem,<br>
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
  first approach: define a <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> that is a list of paths
  to last level directories containing .sym /.sch files
 </li>
 <li>
  second approach: define a <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> that is a list of paths
  one level above the directories containing .sym/.sch files
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In the first approach a 'npn.sym' symbol placed in a schematic will be
  saved as 'npn.sym' in the .sch file, when loading back the parent
  schematic xschem will go through the <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> and look for
  a directory containing npn.sym.
 </p>

 <p>
  In the second approach the 'npn.sym' will be saved as
  'devices/npn.sym' (assuming devices/ is the directory containing this
  symbol) . This is because the <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> is pointing to
  something like /some/path/xschem_library/
  and xschem_library/ contains devices/ (names are just given as
  examples, any dir name is allowed for xschem_library/ and devices/)
 </p>

 <p>
  The first approach is preferred by pcb hobbysts, people working on
  small designs.
  the second approach is preferred for big designs where a one level
  indirection is desired for symbols, so any symbol in xschem is given
  as libname/symname.sym instead of just 'symname.sym'<br>

  For VLSI / big designs I <b>strongly</b> suggest using the second approach,
  just as an example i have the following dirs:
 </p>
 <pre class="code">
  ~/share/xschem/xschem_library/
    containing:
    devices/
    TECHLIB/
  
  ~/xschem_library/
    containing:
    stdcell_stef/
  
  ~/share/doc/xschem/
    containing:
    library_t9/
    dram/
 </pre>
  
 <p>
  then in my xschemrc i have the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  set <kbd>XSCHEM_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd><br>
  $env(HOME)/share/xschem/xschem_library:$env(HOME)/share/doc/xschem/:$env(HOME)/xschem_library<br>
 </p>
 <h3>
  You may choose either method, but please be consistent throughout your design.
 </h3>
