 <h1>XSCHEM PROPERTIES</h1><br>
 <p>
  Properties are text strings that are associated to XSCHEM objects.
  All graphic primitives support properties.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Wires</li>
  <li>Lines</li>
  <li>Rectangles</li>
  <li>Texts</li>
  <li>Symbols</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Consider for example the <tt>res.sym</tt> symbol
  (you may open it with the <tt>Open</tt> menu item)
  if you click inside one of the red pins and press the 'edit property'
  bindkey <tt>'q'</tt> a dialog box
  shows the property string associated with the selected pin:
 </p>
 <img src="edit_property.png">
 <p> 
  The <tt>name=p&nbsp;dir=inout</tt> property string tells that the
  selected pin name is <tt>'p'</tt>,
  this will be the symbol positive pin name in the produced netlist.
  The property string also defines a <tt>dir</tt> attribute with value
  <tt>inout</tt>. This tells XSCHEM that electrically this is an input/output pin.
  This is important when producing VHDL/verilog netlists.
  The second (bottom) pin property string is <tt>name=m&nbsp;dir=inout</tt> and this
  defines the negative pin.
  The text primitives also have properties. For texts the property string is simply the
  displayed text.
 </p>

 <h3>GLOBAL PROPERTIES</h3>
 <p>
  If you click outside of any displayed graphics in XSCHEM
  the selection set will be cleared.
  Clicking the edit property <tt>'q'</tt> key when nothing is
  selected will display the global property string of the
  schematic (.sch) or symbol window (.sym).
  So, in addition to properties associated to graphical objects and
  symbols we also have properties associated to schematic (.sch) and symbol files (.sym)
 </p>

 <p>
  The <tt>format</tt> attribute defines the format of the SPICE netlist. 
  The SPICE netlist element line starts with the 
  symbol name (in this case a resistor so 'rxxxxx'), the list of pins, the
  resistor value and a multiplicity factor (m).<br>
  <tt>@pinlist</tt> will resolve to the parent nets attached to the resistor 
  nodes, in the order they appear in the
  symbol (in this example; first node = 'p', second node = 'm').<br>
  We will return on component instantiation later, but for now,
  considering the following picture:
  </p>
  <img src="nets_pins.png"> 
  <p>
  the <tt>@pinlist</tt> for the <tt>r1</tt> component will expand to <tt>POS&nbsp;NEG</tt>.<br>
  <tt>@value</tt> resolves to the resistor value assigned in component instantiation.
  The <tt>template</tt> attribute defines default values if component
  instantiation does not define values for them.<br>
  If you want to add a pin to an existing symbol you may copy one
  of these. Select a pin, press the copy <tt>'c'</tt>
  bindkey and place a new copy of it somewhere.
 </p>
 <img src="place_pin.png" style="width: 90%;">
 <p>
  After copying the pin you may change its properties, for example you
  will change its property string to 
  something like: <tt> name=body&nbsp;dir=in</tt> (just as an example).<br>
  Note that pins in symbols are nothing more than rectangles
  drawn with the <tt>pin</tt> layer; instead of copying an
  existing one you may create it from scratch, select the pin
  layer from the <tt>Layers</tt> menu, point the mouse where
  you want to place the pin, press the <tt>'r'</tt> bindkey and drag the mouse
  to the desired pin size. There is no inherent limit or assumption
  on pin sizes, you are allowed to create any rectangular/square sizes. 
  After placing the rectangle you must create a property string by selecting it
  and pressing the <tt>'q'</tt> bindkey. An empty string is shown in the
  dialog. Add a valid string as explained and you are all done.
 </p>
 <h3> PIN ORDERING</h3>
 <p>
  An important aspect for symbols is the order of the pins
  when producing the netlist. There are some rules in the order
  for example in SPICE netlist syntax; for example a Bipolar transistor
  has 3 pins and should be in a specific order (collector, base, emitter).
  When done placing pins on a newly created symbol you can specify the order
  by selecting the one that must be the first in the netlist
  and hitting the <tt>&lt;ctrl&gt;s</tt>  bindkey; set the number to zero; 
  this will make the selected pin the first one. Next,
  select the second pin and again hit <tt>&lt;ctrl&gt;s</tt>,
  set its number to 1 and so on.
  By doing so you have defined a specific pin ordering of the symbol.
