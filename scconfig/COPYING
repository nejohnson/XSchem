Most source files are under the LGPL with a very few exceptions: the regex
library is public domain. The explicit copyright banner can be found in each
source file should be considered. For files not having the banner, assume
Copyright (C) 2009..2019 Tibor Palinkas and license GNU LGPL2 (or
later versions of the GNU LGPL).
