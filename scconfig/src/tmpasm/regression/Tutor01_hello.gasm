# Comments start with # and end at the end of the line; comments
# can be started anywhere outside of strings and blocks

# Print will print each argument without appending a newline. An argument
# is a data, string literals are written in brace. Escape sequences
# are as usual
print {hello world!\n}

# Print doesn't have any hidden side effect: no separators printed
# between arguments
print {hello} {world!} {\n}

# Print works without an argument as well: it just prints nothing
print

# instructions are separated by newlines and/or semicolons:
print {HELLO}; print { WORLD!};;;; print {\n};
