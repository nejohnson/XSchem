ViewDraw to Xschem importer script

This directory contains a set of test example schematics to be translated into xschem
the translate.sh script does all the translations, just run it:
  ./translate.sh

translated xschem files will be in xchem_lib/ directory.
the xschemrc file in current directory sets up the library paths 
including the xschem_lib directory with translated schematics/symbols.
Run xschem in current directory so it will set up correctly and find the translated schematics.
Example: 
  ./xschem xschem_lib/dti_28hc_6p5t_40_ffqx1.sch

files are translated one by one by the viewdraw_import.awk script, it is used as follows:

  ./viewdraw_import.awk xschem_lib /path/to/viewdraw/schematic.1 > /path/to/xschem/schematic.sch
or:
  ./viewdraw_import.awk xschem_lib /path/to/viewdraw/symbol.1 > /path/to/xschem/symbol.sym

the first parameter to viewdraw_import.awk is the file to be processed, the second argument 
is the xschem library (directory) that instances will use to reference symbols, i am 
putting all xschem translated objects into xschem_lib/

ViewDraw (and descendents) Schematic Parser
==========================================

As best I (Patrick Yeon) can tell, ViewDraw has been associated with ViewLogic,
Innoveda Corp., and now with Mentor under their ePD and DxDesigner tools.
The format, extended as needed, still shows up in some places in the latest
version of DxDesigner I have seen, even though the iCDB is meant to be the
project database.


The work to understand the format is based off Stuart Brorson and Steven
Salkow's earlier "ViewDraw File Formats" documentation, with Patrick Yeon
working out further extended details based on ViewDraw output files strewn
about online.

Current Status
--------------
The parser can make a decent attempt at parsing schematic and symbol data
from old versions (schematic files with V 51, symbol files with V 50 or 51,
that I've seen).
It has no way to stitch together multi-page designs, and some details fall
through the cracks because they haven't been worked into the upverter
format (yet).

This parser has been developed with the 
[ml50x design files](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/ml50x_schematics.zip)

Bugs, Omissions, and other Brokeness
------------------------------------
At the moment, probably a fair number.
* A few features of the ViewDraw format couldn't be fit into the upverter
output format yet: part flipping and re-scaling, at least

Todo
----
In no particular order:
* Harden up against invalid input
* Work is likely required around pin numbering/naming
* Nets should be streamlined so that they use a minimum of points
* Test, test, test.

How To Help
-----------
I no longer have access to DxDesigner, so any design output to help shore up
the understanding of this format would be helpful,
especially if it is not currently handled properly or completely by the code.
ViewDraw output from other tools/versions would also be helpful.

Further Notes
-------------
From a helpful viewdraw.ini, suspect this is about the `Q` command:
